'''
This Python program is to generates a simple equation with random numbers, such as (3 x ùë• = 12).
Displays the equation using GUI Tkinter.
Check if the user's answer correct and display an appropriate message.
Repeat the process for several equations, keeping track of the user's score.
After all equation questions have been answered, output the total score.
